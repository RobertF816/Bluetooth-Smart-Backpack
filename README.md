# Bluetooth-Smart-Backpack

This project is a system designed to help you never leave behind important items again. Whether your'e a student or in the workforce, this project solves the eternal struggle of leaving something of importance behind, especially when you need it the most. 

This project combines Bluetooth technology using BLE tags with a custom mobile app using Blynk to track essential belongings in your backpack. Users simply attach BLE tags to items of importance, select the tags they want in their bag, and finally leave their home; if they dont recieve a notification within a certain distance from their home, or they want to check for themselves with the push of a button, they can easily know or be reminded of any left behind items.
